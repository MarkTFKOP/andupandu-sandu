# Please complete the following assessment.

# Task: Build a Task Management Application

# Requirements:

1. Backend (Node.js or Java):
2. Create a server that handles CRUD operations for tasks.
3. Use Express.js to set up the server if using Node.js.
4. Use a simple in-memory data store for tasks (e.g., an array).

# Frontend:

1. Design a responsive and visually appealing user interface for the task management application using HTML and CSS.
2. Implement the following features on the front end:
   a. Display a list of tasks.
   b. Add a new task.
   c. Edit an existing task.
   d. Delete a task.

# JavaScript:

1. Use JavaScript to handle client-side logic.

2. Ensure proper data validation and error handling.

# User Interface Framework:

1. Choose between jQuery or React.js for the frontend development.

If using jQuery, demonstrate proficiency in DOM manipulation and AJAX for asynchronous operations.

If using React.js, demonstrate the use of components, state management, and props.

# Additional Considerations:

Implement proper routing for the application (if using React.js).

Provide clear instructions on how to run the application locally.

Include comments in the code to explain complex logic or any noteworthy decisions.

# Submission

Provide a link to your own repository (eg: GitHub) and commit your code to the repository.

Include a README.md file with instructions on how to set up and run the application.

Note: The purpose of this assignment is to assess your coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and familiarity with the specified technologies. Feel free to use any additional libraries or tools that you find necessary. If you have any questions or need clarification on any aspect of the assignment, please include your queries in the README.md file.

Good luck!
